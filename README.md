# hello-world
My first GitHub Project

Hi,

My name is Dustin. I am creating this project to learn about github and the use of git. Currently I am looking for a way to my group handle version control in a project for my capstone ITSCM system analysis and design course. Hopefully this will be a solution that we can go with.
